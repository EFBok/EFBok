								<p>Hi There, pleased to meet you. As you now know, my name is Elijah Bok. I'm 18 years old and I am currently living in Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa.</p> 
								<p>I am taking a gap year to explore my interests and have some independance. At the end of 2019 I matriculated with distinctions and in the following 3 months got a car and a job and moved into an apartment with my brother (who is 11 years my scenior). I'm currently working as a Drone Technician and freelance Drone Operator for a professional cinematography company called <a href="https://www.skyhook.co.za/" target="_blank">Skyhook</a>.</p>

								<p>Since January 2020 I have worked as a Drone Technician, and Pilot for Skyhook. I have done many other things for the compay in that time though, like build a website for them using Squarespace and edit videos for their instagram and do some marketing for their Facebook page.</p>
								<p>I took this gap-year in order to gain some work expirience, but more importantly to have some perspective of life outside of a school environment. To be indipendent and make my own choices. This happened to be a very difficult thing to do and I have learnt an increadible amount since leaving school.</p>
								<p>During the year it was always my goal to learn about and explore my interents more fully. My pssion for Phychology started a couple of years ago when I became obsessed with understanding life and our perception of it. This intrest further piqued when I discovered Jordan B. Peterson. A famous Phychologist from Toronto, Canada. This year I am studying his textbook, Maps of Meaning and watching the hours of lectures he made available for free on YouTube. It is my hope that I will gain insight into my life and others' and be able to be a possitive impact on the world and people around me.</p>
								<p>Some other things I wanted to achiveve this year were learning the basics of coding. I have started on that path and have coded some simple games in python and have learnt to manipulate and use Http and Css in website creation. I have just begun on this journey and I hope to continue.</p>
								<p>I have always been physically active, but it was my goal to become fitter and healthier than ever before this year. So thats what I've been attempting to do. I run 4 or 5 times a week and work out 3 or 4 times a week. I've started doing RomWod - a type of deep, passive streatching - and have become far more flexible. I have started meditating more frequently and hope to continue doing so.</p>
								<p>I am building a website for my brother and hope that he will begin working on his own brand and film making career. He wants to get out of his boring every day job as a VFX artist and start making videos and taking photos for people. We are moving to my grans house in St James, where I hope he will setup his base of operation.</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Where to begin? Well, I was born and raised in a small village called Kommetjie in Cape Town, South Africa. It was a simple lifestyle, one of bear feet and endless summer days. I loved reading from a young age and used to wake up hours before school started to read a couple chapters of my latest novel. I grew up with my Mother and elder Brother (11 years my senior). We got on well enough and my brother taught me about computers from a very early age. This lead me down the path of self actualization. When you suddenly have access to all of human knowledge through the internet, you very quickly have to learn how to seperate the wheet from the chaff as it were. During my journey through the internet I stumbled across FPV Quadcopters. The idea of flight had gripped me from a very young age and I was imediatly enthralled by the thought of flying a drone and wearing a headset to see what the drone was seeing. It was pretty much like flying. This was the first time I used just the internet and my own intellect to teach myself something, and I became pretty damn good at it. I worked as a Drone Technician at a company called <a href="https://flyingrobot.co/" target="_blank">Flying Robot</a> in my school holidays and in the summer of 2017 I went to the national drone racing championships and placed 1st in freestyle and 3rd in the racing catagory.</p>
								<p>Sufficed to say I enjoyed this taste of what knowledge and a little bit of time could accomplish. So looking to my future I decided not to go straight to university, but to take a gap year and explore some of my interests more, using the internet to get free information and my own self disipline to teach myself some skills.</p>
								<p>The interests I am currently exploring are: Psychology, Coding, Guitar, Running, Exercising, Streatching, Poetry, Literature and Writing.</p>
								<p>I'm pursuing these by using online lectures and free resources form the masters in each field. I believe this is the best approach to learning in the 21st Century and that in itself is a skill I am enjoying practicing.</p>
								<p>Next year I am going to Stellenbosch university to study Mechatronic Engineering. I'm very excited to go, but I am glad I took a gap year to learn more about what I am capable of and what I'm interested in.</p>
